## Personal Website
[Live Website](https://andresdanielmtz.github.io/)

Side-project I will update as I improve my abilities in web-developing. It is supposed to reflect my learning in said area and its supposed to change every now and then. 
It is designed to illustrate and show who I am as well as my portfolio: previous projects, courses, education and more. 

**To-do List:**
 - Redesign the [About Me] section. 
 - Design and create the [Contact] and [Projects] sections.
